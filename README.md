This was each members first game jam, and first game. We chose to only work in person and share all discoveries and learnings together. We all walked away happy with how we did and what we learned.

Rough Break Down of time spent.

2.5 hours planning.

1 hour learning and setting up Plastic SCM version control.

11 hours creating MVP.

4 hours polish.

30 minutes submitting.

We were unable to take full use of the 48 hours due to previous obligations.

Project only works on windows due to missed packages during Unity install.
